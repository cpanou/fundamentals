Introduction to Databases:

Database Model

    Entities and their attributes.

    Super Key − A set of attributes (one or more) that collectively identifies an entity in an entity set.

    Candidate Key − A minimal super key is called a candidate key. An entity set may have more than one candidate key.

    Primary Key − A primary key is one of the candidate keys chosen by the database designer to uniquely identify the entity set.
    Foreign Key - A Foreign key is a key that link to primary keys in other tables, thereby creating a relationship


Entity Relationships

    Relationships among entities.
    One-to-one
    One-to-many ( User - Order )
    Many-to-one ( Order - User ) 
    Many-to-many ( Order - Prouct )
